## Overview

FBPurge is a productivity-focused browser extension built for users who want faster and safer correction of their Facebook Friends List. The extension runs **only** when the user opens Facebook and clicks to activate a bulk unfriend session. No extra domain access, no tracking, and no server-side monitoring are involved, keeping the tool predictable and review-friendly for the Chrome Web Store.

## ⚙️ Chrome Permissions

FBPurge uses limited, short-lived host access only on the active Facebook tab, along with local storage flags to remember automation state, suppress repeated lifecycle prompts, and ensure a smooth unfriend workflow. It does not read history, monitor unrelated tabs, bind identity across sites, or export friend profile content to remote destinations.

These permissions are required only to run DOM-level unfriend automation inside `"facebook.com/*"`, triggered by **user consent and click activation**, following Chrome Web Store’s least-privilege and data-minimization principles.

---

## 🔒 Privacy Policy Highlights

The extension operates entirely in the browser sandbox. No personal profile content, browsing logs, history signals, or analytics telemetry data are transmitted or stored remotely. All workflow flags auto-reset when the Facebook tab or browser session ends, preventing unwanted duplicated unfriends or repeated permission requests.

---

## ⚡ Core Features

FBPurge helps users search friend names instantly on the Facebook Friends List tab they open and activate for cleanup. The smart select system supports individual or mass profile selection before unfriending. The DOM-level unfriend automation runs directly in real time, entirely inside the browser, ensuring user control and predictable behavior. Users can stop or cancel anytime during automation and sessions reset safely when tabs close. A free automation trial allows 5 workflow runs before subscription activation if needed, offering flexibility for new users.

## 🖼️ Screenshots & Features Preview

---

Horizontal interface demo can be referenced from your extension lifecycle through the browser's active tab session. Friend DOM scanning and unfriend automation happen only on pages matching `"facebook.com/*"` the user has opened.

---

Interface screenshots help visually ground key features without claiming identity or trademark ownership. The extension UI is clean, well-spaced, labeled clearly, privacy-safe, and suited to bulk unfriending, friend filtering, and automation session control in desktop browsers.

## 🧰 Who This Is For

FBPurge is built for everyday Facebook desktop browser users who want better control of a cluttered friend network. It is also helpful for social managers organizing old connections, professionals correcting mistaken profile adds, or anyone who wants fast mass friend removal without tracking, OAuth, analytics, or persistent server dependencies.
