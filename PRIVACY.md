# Privacy Policy for FBPurge – Fast Friends Remover Pro

*Last updated: October 2025*

Thank you for using **FBPurge – Fast Friends Remover Pro** — a Chrome browser extension created for one clear purpose: enabling users to search, select, and unfriend Facebook profiles in bulk directly from the Facebook Friends List page opened and activated in their browser.

Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how **FBPurge** handles data, manages permissions, protects automation state, and ensures everything remains secure and confined to your device while operating transparently in the active Facebook tab the user chooses to clean.

---

## 1. Introduction

FBPurge (“the Extension”) is developed, maintained, and published by Amit Das. Its design philosophy follows Chrome Web Store’s strict single-purpose requirement, least-privilege principles, and data-minimization expectations. By installing or using the Extension, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

---

## 2. Data Collection

The Extension does **not collect, transmit, sell, or export personally identifiable information (PII)**, including Facebook profile content beyond temporary DOM scanning for friend selection within the active tab session. It never monitors browsing history, reads background tabs, tracks user behavior across websites, harvests analytics signals, or communicates any friend network data to external servers or third-party systems.
All friend scanning, filtering, unfriend automation, and interaction logic occur locally inside the active Facebook Friends List tab the user has opened and explicitly activated for cleanup automation.

---

## 3. Data Storage

FBPurge uses **Chrome’s `storage` API (`chrome.storage.local`)** only to save minimal and non-personal operational state, such as automation activation flags to maintain workflow continuity. The stored data is short-lived, non-sensitive, and resets when the Facebook tab or Chrome browser session ends. It is never used to recreate identity externally across sites or stored permanently as a cross-platform user identifier.
No chat content, personal messages, Chrome profile email addresses, Facebook session cookies, private profile images, or browsing logs are stored beyond what is strictly required to maintain automation state consistency inside a single domain context.

---

## 4. Permissions Overview

The Extension requests host access exclusively for the Facebook domain (`"https://www.facebook.com/*"`), as DOM interaction inside the active tab is required for friend list automation. It also uses `storage`, `tabs`, and `activeTab` only to detect the currently active Facebook Friends List page and remember the automation activation state locally so workflows do not repeat accidentally or cause duplicate lifecycle prompts.
No permissions allow FBPurge to read unrelated domains, monitor browsing history, bind identity across websites, or transmit personal signals off device.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

The Extension does not use any third-party analytics SDKs, advertising networks, external identity providers, tracking pixels, or remote servers to manage friend interactions or store friend lists. All automation stays browser-confined.

---

## 6. Security & Privacy Architecture

Because no user or friend lists are sent externally, all DOM scanning and unfriending automation occurs inside Chrome’s sandbox environment, minimizing data-exposure risk. We encourage users to download the Extension only from the official Chrome Web Store version and keep their browser updated for a secure experience.

---

## 7. User Control

Users can reset the extension state anytime by reopening the Friends List tab and activating a new workflow. They can also remove the Extension at their choice. FBPurge does not leave behind identification data once uninstalled, as no persistent data is written.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

If privacy practices are updated in the future, the policy will be published at the same project URL. We encourage users to review this document periodically to stay informed.
